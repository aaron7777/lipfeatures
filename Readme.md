## Analysis of Lips/Mouth Motion for Deception Detection

###SUMMARY
Previous research is focused on detecting eye-activity level features for deception detection. My research puts emphasis on lips/mouth motion, which is also important part of facial expression. For example, deceptive people are more likely to press or bite their lips.Lips/mouth features (lip corners) are extracted from describers' facial expression in videos. With the analysis of these extractd features, deception detection can be more accurate.

###PROBLEM STATEMENT

Implement a programme to help deception detection through extracting and analyzing the features of lips/mouth of a describer from videos on flimflam.me.
